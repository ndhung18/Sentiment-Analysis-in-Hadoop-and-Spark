## Dataset
To train and test the classification models of each application, [this](http://thinknook.com/twitter-sentiment-analysis-training-corpus-dataset-2012-09-22/) dataset of 1.6 million tweets was used in `csv` format with each line representing a document/tweet with its unique ID, class label, and tweet text as seen below.
